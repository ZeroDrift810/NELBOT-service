# Documentation Hub

I want to keep up to date documentation on all my Madden journey, so this hub will include both snallabot docs and Madden docs. The snallabot folder has snallabot specific documentation that is aimed at anyone looking to contribute to snallabot. The madden folder will be EA and Madden specific documentation that can be generally applicable to anyone looking to use the data availaible. 
## Snallabot

- [Architecture](./snallabot/architecture.md)

## Madden

- [Madden Export API](./madden/export_api.md)
- [Madden EA API](./madden/ea_api.md)
